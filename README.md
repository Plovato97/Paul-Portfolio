# Paul's portfolio Challenge
## First from the ground up complete portfolio website
## On this challenge, I created a portfolio page that can be processed as a full fledge project to implement my portfolio for future interviews or business reviews. 

# CSS
- I created and linked a new style sheet to create a home page that matched my style to engage new recruits and provide an insight to my profile
- I implemented flex box and absolute positioning to provide a clear view of my website within a computer or phone screen.
- I stuck to a similar color pallet to engage the viewer with a simple selection of colors
- I added shadows to the buttons and clickable options to emphasize their priority within the page

# HTML
- I linked multiple projects and contact information to provide multiple avenues of contact and review from my piers. 
- I structured my webpage so it can be accessed with hyperlink within a simple navigation screen. 
- I sectioned off multiple sections within the website.
- I created a full layout with a header and hero involved.
